                        <p>I performed thorough research to identify existing apps similar to the one I aimed to create. For my competitive analysis, I selected Yummly and Kitchen Stories mobile and web apps. I meticulously evaluated each competitor, addressing crucial areas such as Competitor Overview, Marketing Profile, SWOT Analysis, and UX Analysis. This process allowed me to pinpoint key solutions and common design patterns in the competitive landscape.</p>

                        <p>I conducted user research using the Research Learning Spiral (RLS) to precisely define my potential users.

                        <p>In the next phase, I used the insights to figure out the most important features for the basic version of the project, known as MVP. Once I had a good grasp of the user's needs, I started by creating user flows. These flows helped me plan how users would navigate through the project. It gave me a rough idea of what screens and functions were necessary. After that, I moved on to site mapping, where I designed the project's structure and layout in more detail.</p>

                        <p>I created wireframes at various levels of detail for mobile version of the project. To start, I used pen and paper to create low-fidelity wireframes, which allowed me to make rapid changes and improvements. Then I transitioned to mid-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes, using Sketch. For mobile usability testing, I developed a high-fidelity prototype to simulate the final product and gather user feedback.</p>

                        <p>After finishing the UX part, I shifted my focus to shaping the app's visual identity. To conceptualize the app's appearance, I used a style guide. This guide was essential for maintaining consistency in the design. I developed a custom style guide covering elements such as colors, UI components, tone of voice, typography, grids, layouts, and more.</p>
